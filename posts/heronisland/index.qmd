## Summary & Context

This was the second research paper that I wrote during my time abroad at the University of Queensland. This project was conducted at the Heron Island Research Station in the Great Barrier Reef and was based on the fact that microalgae are beneficial to coral reef ecosystems as long as their abundance is balanced out by the ecosystem. We used flow-through tanks to model how nitrogenous waste from sea cucumbers has an impact on the growth of microalgae. Their photosynthetic rate was measured in terms of oxygen production and cell density. My research found that the addition of nitrogenous waste did affect the primary production levels of microalgae.
